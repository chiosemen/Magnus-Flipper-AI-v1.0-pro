# Magnus Flipper AI — Monorepo

**OFFICIAL MONOREPO ROOT:**
/Users/chinyeosemene/Developer/Magnus-Flipper-AI-v1.0-pro

This is the production-grade monorepo for the Magnus Flipper AI system —
a multi-marketplace scanning engine with automated scoring, alerting,
queue-based workers, Telegram/WhatsApp bots, and a Next.js + Expo mobile platform.

**NOTE: The mobile app IS implemented in /mobile/.**
Some earlier documentation incorrectly refers to it as "planned but not built."
